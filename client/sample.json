    "description": "<p>We are a group of weekend warriors who want to enjoy the back roads/4x4 trails of Colorado. We seek dirt, rocks and mud. This group is for anyone with a licensed 4x4 vehicle with low-range. All experience levels and stock to built vehicles with low-range are welcome to join the fun as we explore Colorado. We may be based locally (Colorado Springs) but we will be exploring many areas of Colorado. With a full calendar, there is always plenty to choose from: trails, trails-n-camping, snow bashing, meet &amp; greets and more. Group participation is HIGHLY recommended and encouraged! Can't wait to meet you on the trail!</p>\n<p>Requirements to join our group: 1) Your vehicle must have 4-low/low range 2) You will attend 1 group event every 12 weeks 3) You'll have a fun time on the trail. :)&nbsp;</p>",
